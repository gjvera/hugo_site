Problem 1: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000: [Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/problem1.md" >}} ) 

Problem 2: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms: [Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/problem2.md" >}} ) 

Problem 3: The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143? [Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/problem3.md" >}} ) 

Problem 4: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. [Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/problem4.md" >}} ) 

Problem 5: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?[Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/problem5.md" >}} ) 

Problem 6: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.[Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/problem6.md" >}} ) 

Problem 7: By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?[Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/problem7.md" >}} ) 

Problem 8: The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.
