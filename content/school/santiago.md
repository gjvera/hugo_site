I went to Santiago Canyon College for 3 years after getting out of high school. Getting the classes I needed to transfer proved difficult given the volume of students that attended.

One of the major difficulties I had was getting into the programming and physics classes that were required to transer. There was only one professor at the time teaching C++ class required to transer, and his class filled up really quick. I ended up having to take two classes from him the same semester. One of which was a prerequisite for the other. It was my last semester before transferring. It was difficult, but my passion for coding and learning new programming techniques allowed me to pass both of the classes with an A.
