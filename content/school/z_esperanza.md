I went to Esperanza from Fall 2008 to Spring 2012. My first experience of high school was joining the football team, and meeting many new people. 

School went pretty well, but was fairly challenging due to the amount of time that was required from football. Over time I realized the sport wasn't for me. Not due to the challenge of the sport, but just didn't really fit for me.

After my last season of football my sophomore year I joined the track team. This became one of the decisions I had ever made. Immediately I was having much more fun, and met my best friend who I still talk to 7 years later.

My junior year began with something I had never experienced before, an AP class and a job. I was working at a local Mimi's cafe while juggling school, track, and this new level class. It proved to be a new challenge for me. Lucky for me my mom and her husband were very supportive of me, and did so much to get me through it.
