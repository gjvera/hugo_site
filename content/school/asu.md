I transferred to Arizona State University in Fall of 2015. I picked ASU over a couple schools that I had gotten into including UCSD and UCSC. ASU was certainly a huge change from SCC escpecially since I had moved here from California and it was the first time I had been away from my family. However, I did come here with my best friend from high school so that definitely made the process easier for me. 

Upon registering for my first semester I had enrolled in 18 units, which was not very smart considering I had just gotten a part time job at a restaurant. It was a difficult semester, but I did learn really good time management from it. 

The following semester I had enrolled in only 12 units, so I could properly manage my time and school without my grades suffering. This turned out to a be a smart decision as it was the first semester that I had made the Dean's list at ASU with a GPA of 3.95 for the semester. I ended up doing pretty well the following semesters as well.

Unfortunately, due to the way my classes transferred from SCC and the way the courses were structured at ASU I ended up being one course short of graduating. My final semester at ASU only consited of my second semester of my capstone project, but this ended up being one of the greatest projects that I have had the privelage of working on.
