I was recently introduced to Leet Code by a colleague and have taken a liking to it. 

Upon some further research I have learned that is is very prominent for companies to take problems from these in coding interviews. That in combination with the fact that I am trying to learn more languages made me want to try it. 

It's still a work in progress, but I will post solutions as I go through them in various languages.
