This website is my biggest personal project that I have undertaken. 

It is hosted with [ Github Pages ]( https://pages.github.com ), which by far was the best option for my purpose. I wanted to have a website where I could showcase some projects that would show my skills and what tools and languages I am currently looking at. 

As Github pages only hosts static sites I had to find the best tool to generate a static site that was presentable. A colleague recommended [ Hugo ]( https://gohugo.io/ ) to me, and I could not be happier. It is written in Go, and is incredibly fast. It also has lots of tools to integrate it easily with Github Pages, as well as many other cool features.

The source code for this website can be viewed [ here ]( https://github.com/gjvera/gjvera.github.io ).
