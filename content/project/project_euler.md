A current ongoing project that has piqued my interest is [ Project Euler ]( https://projecteuler.net/ ). Essentially it's a series of math problems for which you need to devise an algorithm and a program to compute the solution. 

I've been using it as a way to ramp up my skills in other languages that I am not comfortable with such as, [ Perl 6 ]( https://perl6.org/ ), [ Clojure ]( https://clojure.org/ ), and [ Ruby ]( https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ ). I chose these languages for different reasons. I chose Clojure because I wanted to get more comfortable with a langauge that has a LISP like format. In addition, Clojure runs on the JVM which was a huge benefit to the language, although there are some cons of using the JVM as well. 

My solutions for these problems can be seen [here]( {{< ref "project_euler_directory" >}}). They can also be seen on my [ Github ]( https://github.com/gjvera/ ). I will also be looking into doing these solutions in other languages in the near future. Other languages I plan on looking at in the future for this are Python and Go.
