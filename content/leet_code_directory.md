<details><summary>Two Sum</summary> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.[Solution]( {{< ref "project_files/leetcode/two_sum.md" >}} )</details> 

<details><summary>Add Two Numbers</summary>You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.[Solution]({{< ref "project_files/leetcode/add_two_numbers.md" >}})</details>

<details><summary>Reverse Integer</summary> Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. 
[Solution]({{< ref "project_files/leetcode/reverse_integer.md" >}})</details>

<details><summary>String to Integer</summary>Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. [Solution]({{< ref "project_files/leetcode/string_to_integer.md" >}})</details>

<details><summary>Palindrome Number</summary> 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.   [Solution]({{< ref "project_files/leetcode/palindrome_number.md" >}})</details>

<details><summary>Letter Combinations of a Phone Number</summary>
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
Example:
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

<details><summary>Remove Nth Node From End of List</summary>
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.
[Solution]({{< ref "project_files/leetcode/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list.md" >}})
</details>

<details><summary>Swap Nodes in Pairs</summary>
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
